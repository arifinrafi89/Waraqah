        'In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the '
            'University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the '
            'course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my '
            'studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland '
            'Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in '
            'India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan '
            'war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps '
            'had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the '
            "enemy's country. I followed, however, with many other officers "
            'who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in '
            'reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at '
            'once entered upon my new duties.',
        'The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it '
            'had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my '
            'brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the '
            'fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a '
            'Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian '
            'artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous '
            'Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by '
            'Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and '
            'succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.',
